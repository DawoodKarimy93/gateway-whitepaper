\section{Governance Token Advanced Usage}\label{sec:gov-token-advanced}
In Chapter \ref{sec:tokens} we have described using the Governance Token to guarantee the trustworthiness of Gatekeepers, by slashing the given stake of Gatekeepers for given protocol infringements (e.g. availability and successful audits by Guardians)

However, this is not the only application of \textit{CVC} as a Governance Token. Through the existing governance processes we envision the introduction of the following mechanisms.

\begin{itemize}
\item Staking of CVC for users in order to lower Pass Operation cost for them. Specifically, the network fee component could be reduced if User proof a sufficient stake of CVC in the network. Furthermore, if specified by the Gatekeeper network, Gatekeeper could also actively lower their prices if a User can prove to stake CVC.
\item Staking of CVC for decentralized Applications. In the current model and Gatekeeper network configuration, in the integration of a dApp to verify a given Gateway Pass is permissionless. However, in certain use-cases it may make sense to let dApps stake as a requirement for Gateway Pass verification. This could allow dApps to cover Pass operation costs for users that are coming into the network via their platform.
\end{itemize}
